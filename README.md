# Find-Local-Volunteers-Project

A project I have made with two other team members, during my CSE471 course lab. It is a Finding Local Volunteers - Project. A system for hiring local volunteers for any particular cause or need. The interface is similar to that of social media - Like FaceBook or LinkedIn. Here I have discussed in detail all the requirements. 

The system was designed using extensive documentation and all the Software Development Life Cycle principles. 

Firstly - An Introduction followed by Motivation. Then a system request will all necessary details along with details of requirement analysis. 

Then comes the Design case. Here Use Case Diagram, then Sequence, Activity, State Machine, Data Flow Diagrams. 

Finally - followed by a conclusion.
